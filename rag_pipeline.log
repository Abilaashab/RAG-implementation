2025-04-05 14:12:30,947 - INFO - Pipeline response: Based on the provided text, a clinical query agent is an AI-powered, large language model (LLM) agent that extracts clinically relevant information from patient history and processes clinical information.  It aims to improve efficiency by surfacing essential information instantly as a clinical query is generated.
